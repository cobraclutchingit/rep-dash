Best Practices & Watch-outs
Architecture & Development

TypeScript Strictness: Enable strict mode in tsconfig.json to catch potential issues early
API Design: Use consistent patterns for all API endpoints
State Management: Prefer React Query for server state and context/hooks for UI state
Mobile First: Always design for mobile first, then enhance for larger screens
Performance: Use Next.js built-in optimizations (Image component, font optimization)
Component Structure: Keep components small and focused on a single responsibility

Database & Data Management

Migration Strategy: Create migration scripts for all schema changes
Connection Pooling: Configure proper connection pooling for production
Query Optimization: Use Prisma's include and select to minimize data transfer
Indexing: Add indexes for frequently queried fields
Soft Deletes: Implement soft deletes for important data

Security Considerations

Input Validation: Validate all inputs on both client and server
Authentication: Always check permissions on server side, never trust client
Environment Variables: Never expose sensitive variables to the client
CSRF Protection: Implement CSRF tokens for sensitive operations
Content Security Policy: Configure proper CSP headers

Mobile Experience

Touch Targets: Ensure all interactive elements are at least 44Ã—44px
Viewport Testing: Test on multiple device sizes
Network Conditions: Test under poor network conditions
Offline Support: Consider adding PWA capabilities for offline access
Data Usage: Optimize image and asset delivery for mobile networks

Monetization Considerations

Payment Processing: Integrate with a secure payment provider
Subscription Management: Build tools for managing subscriptions
Feature Gating: Design system for premium vs. free features
Analytics: Implement conversion tracking
User Retention: Build features that encourage ongoing engagement

Common Pitfalls

Database Connection Limits: Watch out for connection limits in production
API Rate Limiting: Implement to prevent abuse
Memory Leaks: Watch for subscription cleanups in React components
Authentication Edge Cases: Handle token expiration gracefully
Mobile Keyboard Handling: Ensure forms work well with mobile keyboards
Form Validation: Provide clear error messages and validation
